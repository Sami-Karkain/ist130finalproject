+# Neon Courier
+
+A browser-based cyber-arcade runner where you guide a rogue courier through neon-lit districts to deliver encrypted data while uncovering Helix Megacorp's secrets.
+
+## Play
+
+Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Use **WASD** or **Arrow Keys** to move. Hold **E** to hack barriers, dodge drones, and collect energy nodes to reveal the megacorp conspiracy. Grab all six nodes and hack both barriers to complete a run; press **R** anytime for a quick restart.
+
+### Viewing from GitHub
+
+GitHub shows HTML files as source by default. To actually play:
+
+1. Click **Code → Download ZIP** (or clone the repo) and open `index.html` locally, or run `python -m http.server 8000` from the repo root and visit `http://localhost:8000`.
+2. If you prefer a hosted link, enable **GitHub Pages** for the repository (Deploy from branch, root folder). After Pages is enabled, load the site from the published URL to play in the browser.
